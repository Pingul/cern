Small project aimed to help understand the longitudinal motion of particles inside a synchrotron accelerator. Make sure there is a data/ folder in the main directory, as that's where the output data from the simulation is put. Afterwards, the plot.py script can be used to visualize the results.

Some nice commands:

	./run.sh animate
	./run.sh lossmap-analysis
