A small compote of different projects I'm working on at CERN. 

# Overview
## 1. `common` 
Some common C++/Python modules for the different projects.
## 2. `lhcstat` 
Analysis tools for LHC data that uses pytimber.
## 3. `sixtrack_examples` 
Example submission scripts of how to do loss map simulations at the start of the ramp.
## 4. `synchrotron` 
Simplified tracking code for longitduinal oscillations (a.k.a. _the Toy Model_).
## 5. `verify_cmotors` 
Tool that compares collimator Trim functions with their corresponding values for a fill. Checks both normal motor functions and interlocks.
